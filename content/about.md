I was born and raised in Canada but currently live in India with my sweetheart.

I have a degree in computer engineering that I am very proud of, and I use nothing that I learned from school in real life.

I work remotely for a lovely start up company back home doing web development, graphic design, marketing, growth engineering, product management, among other things. Startup life = many hats, and I’m the tech guy.

[I make video games](https://www.youtube.com/c/juul1a "juul1a on Youtube") as a hobby and share my process online, which I am thoroughly enjoying!

[I’ve been doing art since I was a kid](https://www.instagram.com/juul1a/ "juul1a on instagram"), mainly using watercolours, black fine liner pens, pencil crayons, markers, and collage.

I’m a certified yoga teacher but I don’t actively teach, I just do my own little yoga practices at home to stretch out my computer nerd body. (I first came to India to do my yoga teacher training, which is where I met my partner who I am living with now!)

I like fantasy and sci-fi, peanut butter on toast, going on walks, and reminiscing about the days I used to spend playing Counter-Strike 1.6.



### So there’s my story. What’s yours?
